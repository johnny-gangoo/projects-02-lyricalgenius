## Project Overview: 

Lyrical Genius is a Web application that is fun, friendly and simplistic. The way the application highlights this is by first, having the user search 
for a song of their liking, and then second, having them enter the phone number to whom the song will go to. From there, the lyrics to that song will be 
sent, lyric by lyric, to the recipient of their choosing. Although this could be merely looked at as a friendly prank, there is more to it. Lyrical Genius
is a way to let your friends and family know that you are thinking about them, and the songs that you choose can reflect that. By providing the flexibility 
to the user to search for songs and send messages to their friends and family without even having them pick up their phone is a feature that greatly simplifies
the user experience. To conclude, we also want the user interface of our application to look inviting
and friendly, to do this we will use different styling techniques to get the look we desire across.

## Vision Statement:

FOR music lovers WHO want an easy way to send lyrics to their loved ones, Lyrical Genius is a website THAT streamlines the finding and sending of lyrics, UNLIKE searching through google and copying/pasting, OUR product can find and send the lyrics all in a fraction of the time, all from a single webpage. Not only is it simple, fast and free, but also a convenient way for you to send messages without even having to pick up your cellular device. 

## Personas:
- Lisa, age 24, is a musician who recently got married in Nashville, Tennessee, a place known for its music. Lisa is a music enthusiast and after getting her music degree from Vanderbilt University she began song writing. In school, she learned to focus more on what the lyrics of a song are saying rather than the overall melody of the song. Because 
of this, she loves to write love music where the lyrics have deep meaning. Lisa has been a song writer for about three years now and recently started putting her love music on different platforms, notable Spotify, Genius and Apple Music. To surprise and show her husband, Johnny, who has yet to find out Lisa started releasing her music, that she loves him, she wrote him a song. Lisa, not being technically advanced, sought out to find an application that would send the lyrics of her songs to her husband, one by one, because she wants him to show him the affection the words of her song give off. Knowing this, Lyrical Genius would be great for her. Since she is not technically advanced, our UI provides a simplistic interface where all she has to do is search her song and send the Lyrics right to her lover, Johnny.
- Rudy, age 14, is an 8th grader who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. He has always been technologically-savvy, as he has grown up in the generation of smartphones. He doesn’t play any instruments but actively listens to music throughout his day. His middle school Mormon Intermediate school is having their first dance next month and people are already starting to ask each other to the dance. Rudy wants to ask his friend Maddy to the dance but wants to ask in a more personalized way than the generic text. In order to do this, he thought the words of their favorite song “Sugar Sugar” would be the best way to get his message across. By utilizing LyricalGenius’s simple UI, Rudy was able to enter his name, the name of the song, as well as the number he wants to send the lyrics to. Maddy loved the gesture and decided to go with Rudy due to his creativity.
- Tony, age 32, is a businessman living in Manhattan, New York. Tony has a degree in business management from Ithaca College and is very computer literate using a desktop computer every day for work. He has a friend group that he has not seen in a very long time as they have all moved away and started their careers in different parts of the country. Thinking back on the past Tony decides that he wants to get everyone back together for a week get away, a small vacation to go back to the good old days. Remembering an old classic song they all used to listen to when they got together he thinks it would be a great idea to reunite them with some classic lyrics. He instantly thinks of LyricalGenius, he knows that he can quickly and easily send the song lyrics to all of his friends. After everyone has received the lyrics a group conversation quickly forms and the plans are on the way.  
- Josephi Krakowski, age 45, is a salesman of flexible tape. He enjoys hosting Sunday barbecues with his two friends, Philippus Swift and Jothaniel Starr, where many songs are sung and many drinks are drank. However, Krakowski and his friends sometimes forget the lyrics of some of the songs. This is troublesome for them. Krakowski is old-school type of guy, and isn't an avid user of tech. Things like using computers, smart-phones, or key terms in Google search queries aren't relevant to him and trying to search for things can be time-consuming. At one of the barbecues they decide to sing one of their favorite songs, Tom Lerher's "Lobachevsky". The awkward silence that follows the starting of the instrumental tells them that this is one of those times that no one knows the lyrics. But then Krakowski remembers that his son, Josephi Krakowski Jr., recommended him a website called LyricalGenius for finding song lyrics with ease. Krakowski, Philippus, and Jothaniel can now sing their song without worrying about staying up all night searching for their song lyrics.
